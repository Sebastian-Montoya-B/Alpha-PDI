1. AlphaPDIfun.R -> script of the `alpha_PDI` function for calculating the alpha PDI index of generality.

## Functionality and origin

R code provided in this repository can be used to quantify generality of species in consumer-resource interactions.

## Instructions

1.

## (1) AlphaPDIfun

Computes alpha PDI for an interaction matrix (or vectior) and its resource abundance vector.

### Arguments

1.  data -> matrix. The original interaction matrix with consumers in rows and resources in columns.

2.  abun -> vector. It contains the resource abundances of the columns of the interaction matrix.
